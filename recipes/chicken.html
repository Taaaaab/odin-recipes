            <li>Salt and freshly ground blank pepper</li>
            <li>1 3/4 pounds zucchini, sliced into 1-inch chunks</li>
            <li>2 fat garlic cloves, finely grated or minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>

            <li>Heat oven to 425 degrees. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Place zucchini on a rimmed sheet pan and season with a little more salt and pepper</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine garlic, oregano and red pepper flakes. Whisk in oil.

Spread chicken and zucchini in a single layer and roast until chicken is cooked through and zucchini is browned and caramelized, 30-40 minutes. You don't need to turn anything</li>
            <li>Once the pan is out of the oven, squeeze a lemon wedge over everything. Garnish with basil and serve with more lemon wedges and red-pepper flakes on the side.</li>
